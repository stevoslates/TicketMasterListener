Neat code that utilises the Ticketmaster API and gets around deep paging through storing recently scanned eventIDs, code finds the second a new event is added to ticketmaster, allows us to filter through location as needed. Need to build upon to return the events in JSON
to provide the functionalilty to the REST API.
